    <div class="description"><p>Size of circles are proportional to the Gamescore for each game. Gamescore is a measure of how well a player did in the game by combining every stat with a weighted formula. The formula for GameScore is:</p><p> (#Points) + (0.4 * #Field Goals) - (0.7 * #Field Goals Attempted) - 0.4 * (#Free Throws Attempted - #Free Throws Made) + (0.7 * #Offensive Rebounds) + (0.3 * #Defensive Rebounds) + #Steals + (0.7 * #Assists) + (0.7 * #Blocks) - 0.4 * (#Personal Fouls) - #Turnovers = GameScore.</p></div>
